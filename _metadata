This fixes that! They're now [i]correctly[/i] labeled as villagers and no longer take damage from players.\n\n[h1]Mods in the preview screenshot:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Playable Cats Redux:[/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1300828186](link)[/url]\n[*][b]The Modder's Best Friend (OP sword):[/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2137132373](link)[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[spoiler](Yes, my mod testing setup is a pink cat with an OP sword.
